Anna Petrasova, the lead author, 
developed the code, 
%designed the tangible interaction,
prepared the data and model parameters,
designed, implemented, and documented the case study, 
and wrote the paper.

Vaclav Petras helped to develop the code
and help to implement and document the case study.

Derek Van Berkel 
advised on the model,
helped to prepare the data and model parameters,
and edited the paper.

I helped document the case study
and edited the paper. 

%I co-designed the tangible interaction,
%digitally fabricated the physical model,
