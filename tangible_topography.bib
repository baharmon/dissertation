@article{Ratti2004,
abstract = {In recent years, an increasing amount of effort has gone into the design of GIS user interfaces. On the one hand, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with a high degree of sophistication have replaced line-driven commands of first-generation GIS. On the other hand, a number of alternative approaches have been suggested, most notably those based on Virtual Environments (VEs). In this paper we discuss a novel interface for GIS, which springs from recent work carried out in the field of Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs). The philosophy behind TUIs is to allow people to interact with computers via familiar tangible objects, therefore taking advantage of the richness of the tactile world combined with the power of numerical simulations. Two experimental systems, named Illuminating Clay and SandScape, are described here and their applications to GIS are examined. Conclusions suggest that these interfaces might streamline the landscape design process and result in a more effective use of GIS, especially when distributed decision-making and discussion with non-experts are involved.},

@article{Ericsson1980,
abstract = {Behavior and experience are organized around the enjoyment and pursuit of incentives. During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

From the protocol data we identify aspects of creativity in design related to the formulation of the design problem and to the concept of originality. We also apply our observations to a model of creative design as the co-evolution of problem/solution spaces, and confirm the general validity of the model. We propose refinements to the co-evolution model, and suggest relevant new concepts of 'default' and 'surprise' problem/solution spaces. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Connor2015,
abstract = {This paper sets out to challenge the common pedagogies found in STEM education with a particular focus on engineering. The dominant engineering pedagogy remains Òchalk and talkÓ; despite research evidence that demonstrates its ineffectiveness. The paper argues that there is a potential confusion in engineering education around the role of active learning approaches, and that the adoption of these approaches may be limited as a result of this confusion, combined with a degree of disciplinary egocentrism. The paper presents examples of engineering and Òengineering likeÓ projects that demonstrate the effectiveness of adopting pedagogies and delivery methods more usually attributed to the liberal arts such as studio based learning. The paper concludes with some suggestions about how best to create a fertile environment from which inquiry based learning can emerge as well as a reflection on whether the only real limitation on cultivating such approaches is the disciplinary egocentrism of traditional engineering educators.},

abstract = {Making visualizations is integral to scientific thinking. Scientists do not use words only but rely on diagrams, graphs, videos, photographs, and other images to make discoveries, explain findings, and excite public interest. However, in the science classroom, learners mainly focus on interpreting others' visualizations; when drawing does occur, it is rare that learners are systematically encouraged to create their own visual forms to develop and show understanding. Drawing includes constructing a line graph from a table of values, sketching cells observed through a microscope, or inventing a way to show a scientific phenomenon (e.g., evaporation). In this article, we suggest five reasons why student drawing should be explicitly recognized alongside writing, reading, and talking as a key element in science education. We offer distinct rationales, although in practice any single drawing activity will likely rest upon multiple justifications. Both old and new technologies offer exciting opportunities. We conclude by highlighting important questions yet to be answered and key future research to extend teachers' and learners' use of drawing.

abstract = {Spatial thinking skills are critical to success in many subdisciplines of the geosciences. We tested students' spatial skills in geoscience courses at three institutions (a public research university, a comprehensive university, and a liberal arts college, all in the midwest) over a two-year period. We administered standard psychometric tests of spatial skills to students in introductory geology, mineralogy, sedimentology and stratigraphy, hydrogeology, structural geology, and tectonics courses. In addition, in some courses we administered a related spatial skills test with geoscience content. In both introductory and upper level undergraduate geology courses, students' skills vary enormously as measured by several spatial thinking instruments. Additionally, students' spatial skills generally improve only slightly during one academic term, in both introductory and advanced geoscience classes. More unexpectedly, while there was a tendency for high-performing students to be adept at multiple spatial skills, many individual students showed strong performance on tests of one spatial skill (e.g., rotation) but not on others (e.g., penetrative thinking). This result supports the contention that spatial problem solving requires a suite of spatial skills, and no single test is a good predictor of Òspatial thinking.Ó},

abstract = {The emergence of ubiquitous computing as a new design paradigm poses significant challenges for human-computer interaction and interaction design. Traditionally , HCO has taken place within a constrained and well-understood domain of experience-single users sitting at desks and interacting with conventionally-designed computers employing screens, keyboards and mice for interaction. New opportunities have engendered considerable interest in ÔÔcontext-aware computingÕÕÑcomputational systems that can sense and respond to aspects of the settings in which they are used. However, considerable confusion surrounds the notion of ÔÔcontextÕÕÑwhat it means, what it includes and what role it plays in interactive systems. This paper suggests that the representational stance implied by conventional interpretations of ÔÔcontextÕÕ misinterprets the role of context in everyday human activity, and proposes an alternative model that suggests different directions for design.},

We argue that languages created with this approach offer an appealing and practical alternative to text-based and visual languages for classroom use. In this paper we discuss the motivations for our project and describe the design and implementation of two tangible programming languages.

abstract = {We introduce Blended Interaction, a new conceptual framework that helps to explain when users perceive user interfaces as ÒnaturalÓ or not. Based on recent findings from embodied cognition and cognitive linguistics, Blended Interaction provides a novel and more accurate description of the nature of humanÐcomputer interaction (\{HCI).\} In particular, it introduces the notion of conceptual blends to explain how users rely on familiar and real-world concepts whenever they learn to use new digital technologies. We apply Blended Interaction in the context of post-\{ÒWindows\} Icons Menu PointerÓ interactive spaces. These spaces are ubiquitous computing environments for computer-supported collaboration of multiple users in a physical space or room, e.g., meeting rooms, design studios, or libraries, augmented with novel interactive technologies and digital computation, e.g., multi-touch walls, tabletops, and tablets. Ideally, in these spaces, the virtues of the familiar physical and social world are combined with that of the digital realm in a considered manner so that desired properties of each are preserved and a seemingly ÒnaturalÓ \{HCI\} is achieved. To support designers in this goal, we explain how the usersÕ conceptual systems use blends to tie together familiar concepts with the novel powers of digital computation. Furthermore, we introduce four domains of design to structure the underlying problem and design space: individual and social interaction, workflow, and physical environment. We introduce our framework by discussing related work, e.g., metaphors, mental models, direct manipulation, image schemas, reality-based interaction, and illustrate Blended Interaction using design decisions we made in recent projects.},

We focussed on design collaboration because many tabletop systems are intended to support designers in communicating and developing a shared model of the design. The results reveal that the use of TUIs changed designers' spatial cognition, and that these changes affected the design process by increasing their 'problem-finding' behaviours leading to creative design. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present a new, affordable version of TanGeoMS, a tangible geospatial modeling and visualization system designed for collaboratively exploring how terrain change impacts landscape processes. It couples a physical, three-dimensional model of a landscape with geospatial modeling and analysis through a cycle of scanning and projection. Multiple users can modify the physical model by hand while it is being scanned; by sculpting the model they generate input for modeling of geophysical processes. The modeling results are then visualized by projecting images or animations back on the physical model. This feedback loop is an intuitive way to evaluate the impacts of different scenarios including anthropogenic and natural landscape change. Integration with GRASS GIS, a free and open source geographic information system, provides TanGeoMS with a variety of easily accessible geospatial analysis and modeling tools. To demonstrate the environmental modeling applications of TanGeoMS, we will demonstrate how development can be planned based on feedback from landscape processes such as hydrologic simulation and wildfire modeling with variable fuel distribution.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel system for the real-time computational analysis of landscape models. Users of the system Ð called Illuminating Clay Ð alter the topography of a clay landscape model while the changing geometry is captured in real-time by a ceiling-mounted laser scanner. A depth image of the model serves as an input to a library of landscape analysis functions. The results of this analysis are projected back into the workspace and registered with the surfaces of the model. We describe a scenario for which this kind of tool has been developed and we review past work that has taken a similar approach. We describe our system architecture and highlight specific technical issues in its implementation. We conclude with a discussion of the benefits of the system in combining the tangible immediacy of physical models with the dynamic capabilities of computational simulations.},

Dourish used Merleau-PontyÕs phenomenology of perception as the theoretical basis for his discussion of the bodily nature of embodied interaction. This article extends DourishÕs work to introduce the human-computer interaction community to ideas related to Merleau-PontyÕs concept of the lived body. It also provides a detailed analysis of two related topics: (1) embodied perception: the active and embodied nature of perception, including the bodyÕs ability to extent its sensory apparatus through digital technology; and (2) kinaesthetic creativity: the bodyÕs ability to relate in a direct and creative fashion with the ÒfeelÓ dimension of interactive products during the design process.},

abstract = {Conceptual integration is a basic mental operation, in which input conceptual arrays are 'blended' to produce compressed, memorable conceptual packets, congenial to human thought, often with emergent structure not available from the input conceptual arrays. The highest form of conceptual integration is double-scope integration. Double-scope integration is the hallmark of the distinctively human imagination. A double-scope integration network has input conceptual arrays with different, often clashing, organizing frames and an organizing frame for the blend that includes parts of each of those organizing frames and emergent structure of its own. In such networks, both organizing frames make central contributions to the blend, and their sharp differences offer the possibility of rich clashes. Far from blocking the construction of the network, such clashes offer conceptual challenges. The resulting blends can turn out to be highly imaginative. Fifty thousand years ago, more or less, during the Upper Paleolithic, unmistakable archeological evidence began to accumulate of a remarkable set of human singularities: art, science, religion, refined tool use, advanced music and dance, fashions of dress, language, and mathematics. Human beings began to demonstrate an unprecedented ability to be imaginative in whatever they encountered. Cognitively modern human beings throughout the world since that time have demonstrated this remarkable ability, as a routine part of what it means to be human. In The Way We Think, Gilles Fauconnier and I proposed that this change happened in the following way (Fauconnier and Turner 2002). The basic mental operation of conceptual integration, also known as blending, has been present and evolving in various species for a long time. Modern human beings evolved not an entirely different kind of mind, but instead the capacity for the strongest form of conceptual integration, known as doublescope blending. It is the engine of the human imagination.},

This position actually houses a number of distinct claims, some of which are more controversial than others. This paper distinguishes and evaluates the following six claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) off-line cognition is body based. Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.},

Secondly, we describe a prototype system called "Bricks" and a sample application, GraspDraw, which was developed to investigate the Graspable UI concepts and to design new one- and two- handed interaction techniques. The physical artifacts, or bricks, operate on top of a large horizontal display surface known as the ActiveDesk.

The second goal is to present visual and haptic sensation simultaneously by using a single device that doesn't oblige the user to wear any extra equipment. In order to achieve these goals, we designed a new interface device comprising of a flexible screen, an actuator array and a projector. The actuator deforms the flexible screen onto which the image is projected. The user can then touch the image directly and feel its shape and rigidity. Initially we fabricated two prototypes, and their effectiveness is examined by studying the observations made by anonymous users and a performance evaluation test for spatial resolution.},

To explore this space, we developed two systems that integrate actuated shape displays and augmented reality (AR) for co-located physical shapes and 3D graphics. Our spatial optical see-through display provides a single user with head-tracked stereoscopic augmentation, whereas our handheld devices enable multi-user interaction through video seethrough AR. We describe interaction techniques and applications that explore 3D interaction for these new modalities.

The system offers two types of improvements over existing tracking approaches such as computer vision. First, the system tracks objects quickly and accurately without susceptibility to occlusion or changes in lighting conditions. Second, the tracked objects have state that can be modified by attaching physical dials and modifiers. The system can detect these changes in real-time.We present several new interaction techniques developed in the context of this system. Finally, we present two applications of the system: chemistry and system dynamics simulation.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the vision of future interfaces has shifted from virtual reality to augmented and tangible user inter- faces (UI) where virtual and physical (or bits and atoms) co-exist in harmony. Recently, a growing number of de- signers and researchers have been taking the next logical step: creating interfaces where physical, tangible elements are not merely dynamically coupled to the digital attributes and information, but are themselves dynamic, self- reconfigurable devices that can change their physical properties depending on the state of the interfaces, the user, or the environment. A combination of the actuation, self-configuration, and tangibility can expand and enhance the design of tangible interfaces. In this paper, we present an overview of the use of actuation in user interfaces and discuss the rationality of building actuated interfaces. We then discuss actuated interfaces in detail based on our experience designing Lumen shape displays. Work on actuated interfaces is still in its infancy, projects are few and far between, so we consider this paper an invitation to discussion and hope it can help stimulate further research in this area.},

TanGeoMS projects an image of real-world data onto a physical terrain model. Users can alter the topography of the model by modifying the clay surface or placing additional objects on the surface. The modified model is captured by an overhead laser scanner then imported into a GIS for analysis and simulation of real-world processes. The results are projected back onto the surface of the model providing feedback on the impact of the modifications on terrain parameters and simulated processes. Interaction with a physical model is highly intuitive, allowing users to base initial design decisions on geospatial data, test the impact of these decisions in GIS simulations, and use the feedback to improve their design. We demonstrate the system on three applications: investigating runoff management within a watershed, assessing the impact of storm surge on barrier islands, and exploring landscape rehabilitation in military training areas.},

The functions have regular derivatives of all orders everywhere. This makes them suitable for analysis of surface geometry and for direct application in models where derivatives are necessary. For processing of large datasets (thousands of data points), which are now common in geosciences, a segmentation algorithm with a flexible size of overlapping neighborhood is presented. Simple examples demonstrating flexibility and accuracy of the functions are presented.},

@article{Brosius2003,
abstract = {Some years ago there was a proliferation of bottom-up models for conservation under the rubric of community-based conservation. More recently there has been a resurgence of protectionist approaches to conservation, and conservation science has moved to large-scale modeling and planning under rubrics such as ecoregional planning, ecosystem management, and transboundary protected areas. Though recognizing that there are compelling reasons for these shifts, we believe that there are many possible paths to implementation and that it is necessary to maintain community and participation as central precepts of conserva- tion. Our argument proceeds in three stages. First, we examine a series of key concepts and approaches in contemporary conservation that we consider problematic. Second, we describe three current research trajectories that we believe have considerable promise in contributing to the development of future approaches to conservation. Finally, we propose a number of specific measures that we believe will lead toward the implementation of conservation initiatives that are simultaneously more effective, just, and equitable. Central to our argument is the call for a social definition of conservation.Wealso stress the need for practitioners to de- vote more effort to building local constituencies for conservation. This approach validates and encourages small-scale, local conservation ef- forts, links conservation with issues such as soil fertility degradation and loss of traditional food crop varieties, and entails a new kind of relation- ship between grassroots groups and international organizations.},

This analysis incorporates biophysical, socioeconomic, and land use/tenure data collected by a multidisciplinary team of Guatemalan and American researchers in order to identify potential management plans and multiple-use/concession arrangements. The Sierra Chinaja is a classic paper park protected area in Guatemala. Many factors have rendered Guatemalan protected areas management policies ineffectual in the Sierra Chinaja despite the fact that it has been an area of special protection since 1989. Proximate causes of forest conversion mask underlying driving forces responsible for rapid biodiversity loss. Despite the fact that Guatemalas protected areas management system is similar to that promoted by international conservation organizations it has yet to effectively conserve biodiversity. These factors suggest that protected areas management in Guatemala, and other developing nations possessing unique cultural and natural histories, must be rooted in the local context as promulgated by the local non-governmental organization ProPeten in their proposal for an official Indigenous Reserve category. The proposal suggests the devolution of management responsibilities from federal institutions to local communities in the effort to develop a community-based, site specific conservation agenda.},

abstract = {Conservation organizations are increasingly turning to landscape approaches to achieve a
balance between conservation and development goals. We use six case studies in Africa and Asia to explore
the role of participatory modeling with stakeholders as one of the steps towards implementing a landscape
approach. The modeling was enthusiastically embraced by some stakeholders and led to impact in some
cases. Different stakeholders valued the modeling exercise differently. Noteworthy was the difference
between those stakeholders connected to the policy process and scientists; the presence of the former in
the modeling activities is key to achieving policy impacts, and the latter were most critical of participatory
modeling. Valued aspects of the modeling included stimulating cross-sector strategic thinking, and helping
participants to confront the real drivers of change and to recognize trade-offs. The modeling was generally
considered to be successful in building shared understanding of issues. This understanding was gained
mainly in the discussions held in the process of building the model rather than in the model outputs. The
model itself reflects but a few of the main elements of the usually rich discussions that preceded its
finalization. Problems emerged when models became too complex. Key lessons for participatory modeling
are the need for good facilitation in order to maintain a balance between ``models as stories'' and technical
modeling, and the importance of inviting the appropriate stakeholders to achieve impact.},

Since 2008 graduate students at North Carolina State University have the opportunity to take a course on geospatial modeling and analysis that is taught with both proprietary and free and open source software. In this course, students perform geospatial tasks simultaneously in the proprietary package ArcGIS and the free and open source package GRASS GIS. By ensuring that students learn to distinguish between geospatial concepts and software specifics, students become more flexible and stronger spatial thinkers when choosing solutions for their independent work in the future. We also discuss ways to continually update and improve our publicly available teaching materials for reuse by teachers, self-learners and other members of the GIS community. Only when free and open source software is fully integrated into geospatial education, we will be able to encourage a culture of openness and, thus, enable greater reproducibility in research and development applications.},
